Matt Auerbach is a NYC-based Developer Advocate at Twitch. The Advocacy Team educates developers regarding products and offerings, and acts as the primary point of contact for assistance and feedback. Matt is a mild-mannered programmer who enjoys using technology to solve problems and make people's lives easier. By night, however... Well he does pretty much the same thing. You can find Matt streaming on /TwitchDev or /Mauerbac, and building tutorials on glitch. He previously worked in developer relations at Optimizely, Amazon Web Services, and Twilio.
