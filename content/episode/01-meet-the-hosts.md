Jason and Mary introduce themselves and announce that they’re starting a podcast on building communities. Why? There are a lot of really awesome communities and fantastic ideas both within and outside of the tech community, but there aren’t a lot of resources for those of us who are actively building communities. (Shoutout to [Jason Hibbets](https://twitter.com/jhibbets) for suggesting our name: Community Pulse.)

In short, this podcast is for those of us who keep a pulse on our communities. Our hope is that this podcast will be an opportunity for us to learn and share aspects of community building with developer evangelists, technical community managers, community builders, and advocates alike.
