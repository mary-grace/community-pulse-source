Description = "Jason and Mary talk about content that we produce for our personal brands as well as our corporations. What lines do we draw to maintain the boundary of our personal versus professional lives? And if that line gets blurred, how do we push pause to be able to recoup our energy and prevent burnout? We also touch on the importance of producing content that's specific to your learning style even if that topic has already been covered, because other folks likely learn the same way you do."
