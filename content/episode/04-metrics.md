On this episode of the Community Pulse, Jason and Mary sit down with [Tim Falls](https://twitter.com/timfalls), Vice President of Community at [Keen](https://keen.io/), and [Jesus Gonzalez-Barahona](https://twitter.com/jgbarah), co-founder of [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/), to dig into metrics -- the community manager’s arch nemesis. We talk through a number of different options of how to face the reality of making your value known in a world where community is all about relationship-building and word-of-mouth. From bringing awareness to what you’re doing as a team, to not just knowing the numbers, but understanding what the numbers mean, to bringing other coworkers into the community effort whose job titles don’t indicate that they “should” be involved in community, Jesus and Tim offer solutions to this very real problem.
