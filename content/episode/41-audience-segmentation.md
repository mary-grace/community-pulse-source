title = "Audience Segmentation: Why Finding Your Core Community is an Integral Piece of a Successful DevRel Strategy"
Description = "Figuring out what segment of the technical industry your product is focused on can be a difficult endeavor, but it’s necessary in order to set your DevRel team up for success. “Developers, Developers, Developers” has a nice ring to it, but in reality, is far too large of a group to focus on. In this episode of Community Pulse, our hosts are joined by Sarah-Jane Morris, Founder of Listen Community Consulting, and Jesse Davis, Executive VP of Product and Technology at Devada, to talk about audience segmentation and how it plays into building a sustainable DevRel strategy."

  * A reminder to make time for yourself. For me, that’s been waking up 20-30m early (when I can convince myself to do so!) and reading while drinking my coffee instead of being on my phone or computer right after waking up. Taking a moment to breathe & start the day off right.


* SJ Morris
  * Currently reading Jia Tolentino’s [Trick Mirror](https://amzn.to/2J3SktR): a collection of essays from one of my fave journalists (on the New Yorker staff, formerly of Jezebel), on navigating our senses of self online, offline and through a feminist lens in this surreal global political moment.


* Jesse Davis
  * As an outdoor enthusiast and a father of 3 boys, I’ve recently become fascinated with the idea of Nature Deficit Disorder. The idea that as our society becomes more connected we lose touch with those things that we need most of all: fresh air, peace and quiet, and uninterrupted connection with other humans in a natural setting. I’m working on ways to build that within my tightest community, my wife and kids, by doing more hiking, fishing, and campfire time.
