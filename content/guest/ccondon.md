Former musical theatre actress and Hackbright Academy graduate, Chloe is now a Developer Evangelist at [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). Pre-Hackbright, she spent her nights and weekends performing in the Bay Area as a singer/actress and worked in tech by day. To support her theatre career, she started to learn to code through online resources. Perhaps the only engineer you'll meet who has been in _Hairspray_, _Xanadu_, and _Jerry Springer: the Opera_, she is passionate about bringing people with non-traditional backgrounds into the world of tech. If you're trying to place her face, yes -- she's the young woman giving the awkward thumbs up in the [What It's Like to be a Woman at a Tech Conference](https://shift.newco.co/what-its-like-to-be-a-woman-at-a-tech-conference-8a1a299ac82b) article (which she also wrote). A quick Google search of her will provide you with getting started with Docker videos, observability articles, theatre reviews, tech blogs, and videos of her singing.
