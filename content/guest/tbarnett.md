Taylor Barnett is a Senior Community Engineer at Transposit. She is passionate about building great developer experiences with an emphasis on empathy and inclusion within Product, documentation, and other community-focused projects. After leaving software engineering, Taylor led Developer Relations at Stoplight, an API design management platform, and worked with the developer community, SDKs, and documentation at Keen, a data analytics API company. In her free time, she's either climbing rocks with friends, trying to find the funkiest sour beers, or hanging out with her corgi, Yoda, in Austin, Texas.
