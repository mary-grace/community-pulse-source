Description = "Mary and PJ join Jason to sync up on the recent episode that he hosted about [Codes of Conduct](http://communitypulse.io/29-coc/). We cover a lot of ground: from the purpose that Codes of Conduct serve, to the fact that we agree to these standards in day-to-day life without realizing it, to the recent news stories about CoCs."
