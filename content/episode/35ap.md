title = "After Pulse: Under the Influencer"
Description = "Mary and PJ recap the conversation they had with Marshall Kirkpatrick and Rachel Happe in [Episode 35](http://communitypulse.io/35-under-the-influencers/) and continue to chat about the difference between popularity and influence. As DevRel professionals continue to gain influence in various fields, it's important that we have conversations around the expectations for those influencers: Should they be held to a higher standard? Is it fair to do so? We also talk about how to elevate other folks who may be new to the industry or have a smaller platform but have good insights to share."
