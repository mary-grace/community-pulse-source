title = "After Pulse: Finding the DevRel in You"
Description = "PJ and SJ expand on some of the topics addressed in [Episode 44](http://localhost:1313/44-finding-devrel-in-you/), including how our differences are part of what makes us uniquely capable to fulfill our Developer Relations responsibilities. They also touch on the pros and cons of creating a clear career path for the DevRel and Community industries and why it might not be necessary for you to move to San Francisco to succeed as a new DevRel professional _(gasp!)_ as well as how our career paths are drastically different from those of our parents and grandparents."
