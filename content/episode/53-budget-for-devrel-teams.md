title = "Budgets Rule Everything"
Description = "As we’ve mentioned in previous episodes, budget concerns are an ever changing part of working in DevRel. Now more than ever, DevRel teams are expanding their functions and responsibilities while stretching the idea of how we do the things we do. In this episode, we sit down with Bear Douglas of Slack to talk budgets, what budget allocations mean to a DevRel and how do you calculate what you need vs what you want?"
