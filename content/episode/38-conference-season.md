title = "Conference Season: Is it a Thing?"
Description = "_Conference Season_ used to be a definitive time of year -- the time when things were chaotic and everything revolved around travel, talks, sponsorships, and schedules. But these days it seems like the whole year is chock-full of conferences, big and small. So how can we help build an event strategy that's sustainable, not only for our team, but for our budgets? Amanda Gonser, Manager of Community Events and Content at PagerDuty, and Matt Auerbach, Event Director at Twitch and Co-founder of Confir, join Mary, PJ, and Jason to talk about all of these topics and more."
