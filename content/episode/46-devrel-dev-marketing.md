Description = "It’s not hard to say there is a difference between Developer Relations and Developer Marketing... but where does that line sit? There is definitely overlap, but how do we identify efforts or activities that fall more into one category or the other? To help us define these roles and where those lines might be, we are joined by guests Elizabeth Kinsey and Karen White."
