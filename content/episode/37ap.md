Description = "PJ, Jason, and Mary recap the [conversation](http://communitypulse.io/37-whats-in-name/) with Bear Douglas and Jeremy Meiss. They touch on how the growth of the industry has impacted Developer Relations job titles as well as salaries before meandering into personal brand. At the end of the day, is it really our job title that matters or is it more about how we interact with others?"
