Shannon Burns is an engineering manager working on internal developer tools at Slack. She loves that she gets to spend her days nerding out on improving the working lives of her coworkers. Before building internal tools, Shannon was a Developer Advocate and speaker, working at Slack and Nginx. In her efforts to fight the gender inequity in tech, she founded Hacking for Women, the first forward-funded scholarship program for women in coding. She’s also an artist, singer, and mentor to aspiring engineers from atypical backgrounds in the Bay Area.
