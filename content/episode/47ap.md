title = "After Pulse: Online Community Management"
Description = "SJ, Jason, and PJ sit down to discuss their recent conversation with Marjorie and Wesley. What started as a simple conversation about online communities turned into an opportunity to learn from experts at a time when our entire industry seems to have been turned on its head. They then pivot into what makes something ephemeral versus what sticks with you and has a lasting impact on your career as well as those around you."
