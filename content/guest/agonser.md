Amanda Gonser is the Manager of Community Events & Content at PagerDuty, where she owns developer events and helps internal teams produce technical content. She develops and runs internal programs to help new speakers find and improve their public voice. Over the years, Amanda has gained unique perspective on event sponsorships, metrics, and ROI by managing developer events from an organizer perspective. She leverages that experience to help companies get more from their presence at field events. When she's not living and breathing all things events, Amanda is exploring #librarytourism, hiking in the Pacific Northwest, or burying her nose in a good book.
