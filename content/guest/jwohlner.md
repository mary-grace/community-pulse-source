Jill Wohlner is a spirited Recruiting Leader with over 7 years experience in the technical recruiting field. She received her Masters in Industrial/Organizational Psychology with plans to change the way organizations treated their employees. When that didn’t work out she started recruiting :wink:. Jill’s main priorities in her work are the humans she interacts with and the relationships being built. She strongly believes that recruiters are a strategic/impactful arm to any organization and that the work they do matters. Jill is also known to chat incessantly about her dogs, give hugs like they are going out of style and feels lucky to work at a company (Fastly) where she can be based in her hometown of St. Louis, MO.
