Karissa is a Sr. Developer Relations Program Manager at Microsoft and previously spent time building community at Bugsnag & New Relic. She loves Go + Python and has too many IOT side projects started. Prior to her transition into the magical work of developer relations she was a cancer researcher for 9 years. Due to her work in bio science she is prone to asking about sample sizes and standard error when presented graphs, and assumes discussions of funnels are not about marketing. She spends her weekends racing on sailboats and also enjoys sewing clothes.
