title = "COVID-19 Retrospective - Community Pulse LIVE!"
Description = "This has been a surreal and historic few weeks across the globe. We recently gathered a group of DevRel professionals to talk about how COVID-19 has impacted them and their DevRel role, from what their current focuses are, how their Q2 goals have changed, whether they're transitioning to online events (and what that will look like in the future), and more. Join us for a special live episode as we dig into the potential long term changes to our industry post COVID-19."
