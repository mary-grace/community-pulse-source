What happens when you change jobs and have to move from one community to another?

When it's time to look for a new job... do you stick with the same community? Or do you seek out a change of some type?

Are there companies or brands that you can't see yourself ever working for?

Listen in as Jason and PJ chat with guests Alyss Noland and Joel Lord on these topics and more
