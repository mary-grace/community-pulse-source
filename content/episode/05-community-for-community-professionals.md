[David Spinks](https://twitter.com/davidspinks) (CEO, CMX Media) and [Carrie Jones](https://twitter.com/caremjo) (Director of Content, CMX Media) joined Mary and Jason for this episode of Community Pulse. [CMX](http://cmxhub.com/) was launched in 2014 as the community for community professionals. These days, through their summits, online community, content, and more, they work to advance the community industry, and give community professionals all of the resources they need to be successful.

The [CMX Summits](http://cmxhub.com/summit) bring in voices from psychology and behavioral analysis, as well as non-profits, plus stories from the trenches of technology. The theme for CMX West 2015 was “Community is the Future of Business.” We talk through this idea, and what it means for the future of community professionals, as well as why the essence of community is at a tipping point right now. In the process, we highlight how to help companies understand what it’s like to build community on a professional level, how to set the standards for this relatively new role, and more.
