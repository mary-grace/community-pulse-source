After many years of ghostwriting, Emily Freeman made the bold (insane?!) choice to switch careers into software engineering. Emily is the author of DevOps for Dummies (April 2019) and the curator of [JavaScript January](http://javascriptjanuary.com/) — a collection of JavaScript articles which attracts 30,000 visitors in the month of January. A former VP of Developer Relations, Emily is a CloudOps Advocate at Microsoft and lives in Denver, Colorado.
